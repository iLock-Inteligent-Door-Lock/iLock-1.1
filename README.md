This is the version 1.1 of our product. WiFi ESP8266 NodeMCU V3 module connected to ultrasonic sensor hc-sr04. We used the Blynk website to monitor the distance of the object from the sensor.

Next we are planning to:
-use a smaller distance sensor to allow the product to be mounted inside the door
-create own application that will download data from the server and inform the user whether the door lock has been locked
